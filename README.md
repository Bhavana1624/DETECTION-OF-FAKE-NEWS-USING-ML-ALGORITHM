# DETECTION-OF-FAKE-NEWS-USING-ML-ALGORITHM
Fake news detection has become a critical challenge in the era of information overload. This project explores the application of ML algorithms, in cluding logistic 
regression, gradient boosting classifier, random forest classifier, and decision tree classifier, to tackle the issue of identifying the information. The project 
involves a comprehensive analysis of these algorithms in the context of fake news detection.The project begins with the collection and processing of news articles, 
aim ing to create a reliable dataset for training and testing purposes. Logistic regression, known for its simplicity and efficiency, is employed as a baseline model. 
In paral lel, gradient boosting classifier, random forest classifier, and decision tree classifier algorithms are implemented to harness the strengths of ensemble 
learning and tree based strUCtures.The training phase involves exposing each algorithm to the process dataset, enabling them to learn patterns indicative of fake or 
genuine news. Subse quently, the models are tested using a separate dataset to assess their performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and 
F1-score are employed to quantify the effectiveness of each algorithm.Addressing this issue necessitates effective detection mechanisms to distinguish between 
genuine and fabricated news articles. This study proposes a random forest classification approach for fake news detection, leveraging a comprehensive set of textual 
features derived from news content and metadata. The random forest algorithm is known for its robustness and efficiency in handling high dimensional data, making it 
suitable for this task. Through rigorous experimentation on a diverse dataset, our proposed method demonstrates promising results with high accuracy, precision, and 
recall. Additionally, feature importance analysis reveals the crucial role of certain textual and metadata attributes in distinguishing between real and fake news. 
The findings of this research contribute to the advancement of automated fake news detection systems, offering a reliable and scalable solution to combat the spread 
of misinformation.
